Assignment 2
Difference between declaration,definition and initialization.
Declaration -allocates memory and the definiton assigns a value to this allocated memory.

example:var x=1
x is being declared in the beginning while its definition comes at the line specified.


Definition-to show how something is implemented.
example:class function and variable

Initialization- is the means of assigning an intial value to a variable.so undefined is the inital value of a declared variable.
example:var a;="foo"
